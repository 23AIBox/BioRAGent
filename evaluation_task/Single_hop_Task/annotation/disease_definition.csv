What is (are) Diabetes ?,"Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.
                
Diabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.
                
Insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.
                
If beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. In diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.
                
Over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. No one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.
                
The two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. A third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. Other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. Some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.<"
What is (are) Neurofibromatosis Type 1?,"A clinically heterogeneous, neurocutaneous genetic disorder characterized by cafe-au-lait spots, iris Lisch nodules, axillary and inguinal freckling, and multiple neurofibromas."
What is (are) Hypoglycemia ?,"Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, is when blood sugar decreases to below normal levels. This may result in a variety of symptoms including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures or death. A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness and weakness may also be present."
What is (are) Marfan Syndrome?,"A disorder of the connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body such as bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. At least 25% of cases are due to a new (de novo) mutation. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms in each person."
What is (are) Fragile X Syndrome ?,"A genetic syndrome caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene which is responsible for the expression of the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein. This protein participates in neural development. This syndrome is manifested with mental, emotional, behavioral, physical, and learning disabilities."
What is Medullary thyroid carcinoma,A neuroendocrine carcinoma arising from the C-cells of the thyroid gland. It is closely associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Approximately 10% to 20% of medullary thyroid carcinomas are familial. Patients usually present with a thyroid nodule that is painless and firm. In the majority of cases nodal involvement is present at diagnosis. Surgery is the preferred treatment for both primary lesions and recurrences. This carcinoma is generally not very sensitive to radiation and almost unresponsive to chemotherapy.
What is Leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy,"A peroxisomal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spasmodic torticollis, dystonic head tremor, intention tremor, nystagmus, hyposmia, and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism with azoospermia. Slight cerebellar signs (left-sided intention tremor, balance and gait impairment) are also noted.

What is (are) Prolactinoma ?,"A prolactinoma is a benign noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland that produces a hormone called prolactin. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary tumor. Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by hyperprolactinemia --- too much prolactin in the blood --- or by pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues.Prolactin stimulates the breast to produce milk during pregnancy.  After giving birth, a mothers prolactin levels fall unless she breastfeeds her infant. Each time the baby nurses, prolactin levels rise to maintain milk production."
What is Congenital disorder of deglycosylation,"A rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by mutations in the NGLY1 gene.

What is Gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome,"A rare genetic disease characterized by multiple intestinal atresia in association with combined immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical features include widespread atresia extending from the stomach to the rectum, homogenous calcifications in the abdominal cavity, hepatic cholestasis, cirrhosis, and chronic liver failure, hypoplastic thymus, and increased susceptibility to mainly bacteria and viruses. The immunological phenotype consists of profound generalized T-cell lymphopenia and milder natural killer cell and B-cell lymphopenia, as well as low serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, with elevated serum IgE. The disease is mostly fatal in infancy or childhood."
What is Chronic atrial and intestinal dysrhythmia,"A syndrome characterized by a unique combination of cardiac arrhythmias and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. It has material basis in the mutated SGOL1 protein.

What is (are) Achondroplasia?,"Achondroplasia is the most common form of chondrodysplasia, characterized by rhizomelia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, brachydactyly, and macrocephaly with frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia."
What is Achromatopsia,"Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a rare autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by color blindness, nystagmus, photophobia, and severely reduced visual acuity due to the absence or impairment of cone function."
What is Acrocallosal syndrome,"Acrocallosal syndrome (ACS) is a polymalformative syndrome characterized by agenesis of corpus callosum (CC), distal anomalies of limbs, minor craniofacial anomalies and intellectual deficit."
What is (are) Acromegaly ?,"Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from too much growth hormone (GH) in the body. The pituitary, a small gland in the brain, makes GH. In acromegaly, the pituitary produces excessive amounts of GH. Usually the excess GH comes from benign, or noncancerous, tumors on the pituitary. These benign tumors are called adenomas.
                
Acromegaly is most often diagnosed in middle-aged adults, although symptoms can appear at any age. If not treated, acromegaly can result in serious illness and premature death. Acromegaly is treatable in most patients, but because of its slow and often &quot;sneaky&quot; onset, it often is not diagnosed early or correctly. The most serious health consequences of acromegaly are type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. Patients with acromegaly are also at increased risk for colon polyps, which may develop into colon cancer if not removed.
                
When GH-producing tumors occur in childhood, the disease that results is called gigantism rather than acromegaly. A child&apos;s height is determined by the length of the so-called long bones in the legs. In response to GH, these bones grow in length at the growth platesareas near either end of the bone. Growth plates fuse after puberty, so the excessive GH production in adults does not result in increased height. However, prolonged exposure to excess GH before the growth plates fuse causes increased growth of the long bones and thus increased height. Pediatricians may become concerned about this possibility if a child&apos;s growth rate suddenly and markedly increases beyond what would be predicted by previous growth and how tall the child&apos;s parents are.</Answer>

What is Otofaciocervical syndrome,Any otofaciocervical syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the EYA1 gene.
What is Brody myopathy,"Brody myopathy is a hereditary condition that affects the skeletal muscles (muscles used for movement). Symptoms typically begin in childhood and are characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening (myopathy) after exercise or other strenuous activity. These symptoms can worsen in cold temperatures and are usually painless, however, some individuals may have mild discomfort. Some cases of Brody myopathy are caused by mutations in the ATP2A1 gene. The cause of Brody myopathy for individuals not found to have an ATP2A1 gene mutation remains unknown. Brody myopathy is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with a few reported cases of autosomal dominant inheritance. While there is no one treatment for Brody myopathy, certain muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene and blood pressure medications called calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil may be useful. Some researchers suggest that individuals found to have an ATP2A1 gene mutation have a slightly different disorder in which symptoms appear at an earlier age. They use the disease term 'Brody disease' for individuals with an identifiedmutation versus 'Brody syndrome' for those that do not. More research may help clarify whether these are two different disorders or a variation of the same disorder."

What is Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency,"Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency (GNMT deficiency) is a very rare condition characterized by persistent and isolated excess levels of methionine in the blood (hypermethioninemia). The only clinical abnormalities are mild increase of the liver size (hepatomegaly) and chronic elevation of the transaminase levels in the blood without liver disease. Methionine may also be increased in urine. However, because elevated levels of methionine in the blood itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms, people with GNMT deficiency can have neurological problems when methionine levelsare greater than 800Ã×mol/L. GNMT deficiency is caused by mutations in the GNMT gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Treatment is not needed in most cases."
