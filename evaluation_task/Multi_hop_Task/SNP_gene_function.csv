What is the function of the gene associated with SNP rs1241371358?  ,Predicted to be active in cytosol.,"The gene associated with SNP rs1217074595 is FKBP5 (FK506 binding protein 5). FKBP5 encodes a protein that is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which plays a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds to the immunosuppressants tacrolimus (FK506) and sirolimus (rapamycin). It is thought to mediate calcineurin inhibition. Additionally, FKBP5 interacts functionally with mature corticoid receptor hetero-complexes, along with the 90 kDa heat shock protein and PTGES3 (P23 protein). As an Hsp90-associated co-chaperone that regulates the responsiveness of steroid hormone receptors, FKBP5 plays an important role in stress endocrinology and glucocorticoid signaling.

EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Function of IFIH1/MDA5:

Pathogen Recognition: MDA5 is a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that detects viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common replication intermediate of many viruses. Upon recognition of dsRNA, MDA5 initiates antiviral immune responses.

Immune Response Activation: Activation of MDA5 leads to the production of type I interferons and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for controlling viral infections.

Role in Autoimmunity: Variants in the IFIH1 gene have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus.

In summary, the IFIH1 gene plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by detecting viral components and triggering antiviral responses."
